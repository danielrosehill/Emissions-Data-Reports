## Reporting Combinations

There are seven possible permutations for how companies can report emissions data across none or all of scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3:

**No Reporting**
- `[]`: Company does not report any emissions data, possibly indicating early stages of sustainability reporting or lack of measurement capabilities

**Single Scope Reporting**
- `['Scope 1']`: Focus on direct emissions from owned operations
- `['Scope 2']`: Focus on indirect emissions from purchased energy
- `['Scope 3']`: Focus on value chain emissions

**Dual Scope Reporting**
- `['Scope 1', 'Scope 2']`: Common combination focusing on operational control
- `['Scope 1', 'Scope 3']`: Unusual combination skipping energy consumption
- `['Scope 2', 'Scope 3']`: Unusual combination skipping direct emissions

**Complete Reporting**
- `['Scope 1', 'Scope 2', 'Scope 3']`: Comprehensive emissions reporting across all categories
