# Common Measurement Units in GHG Emissions Reporting

| Name | Definition | Other Names |
|------|------------|------------|
| tCO2e | Metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent; universal unit to indicate global warming potential of greenhouse gases relative to one unit of CO2 | Carbon dioxide equivalent, CO2 equivalent |
| kgCO2e | Kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent; commonly used for smaller-scale emissions measurements | Kg carbon equivalent |
| CO2e/kWh | Carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt hour; used to measure emissions intensity of energy consumption | Carbon intensity factor |
| GWP-100 | Global warming potential over 100 years; measures the long-term impact of different greenhouse gases compared to CO2 | 100-year global warming potential |
| kgCO2e/unit | Kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per specific unit of measurement (e.g., per product, per kilometer) | Emission factor, carbon intensity |
| MtCO2e | Million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent; typically used for large-scale or national emissions reporting | Million tons CO2e |

# Disambiguation: Regional Variations In Carbon Dioxide Reporting Units

| Term | Definition | Equivalence | Notes |
|------|------------|------------|--------|
| MMTCO2e | Million Metric Tonnes of Carbon Dioxide Equivalent | = 1,000,000 tCO2e | Common in US documentation and EPA reports |
| MtCO2e | Million Tonnes of Carbon Dioxide Equivalent | = 1,000,000 tCO2e | More common in European and international documentation |
| MMTCDE | Million Metric Tonnes of Carbon Dioxide Equivalent | = MMTCO2e = MtCO2e | Alternative abbreviation, less commonly used |

- "MMT" (double M) is more commonly used in US documentation
- "Mt" (single M) is more commonly used in European and international contexts
